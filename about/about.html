    <h5> Welcome to my blog. </h5>
    <p><h5>About:</h5> Hi, I'm currently a first year graduate student in mathematics at <a href="http://www.math.tifr.res.in/" target="_blank"> TIFR </a>,
    Mumbai, India. I did my bachelor and master in mathematics at ISI, Bangalore.<br>
    In this blog I will be posting about things which I will find fascinating in course of my study as well document some other stuffs for myself so that<br>
    I don't them forget later.

        <h5>These are the things which interest me: </h5>
          <p> <h5> Quantum Mechanics:</h5>
  Well, my relationship with Physics has been a love-hate story. In first 2.5 years of my undergrad, I hated physics courses(classical mechanics, 
              statistical physics and electromagnetism) so much that I didn't gave my optional backpaper as I didn't wanted to study them again. I hated
              physics courses and other applied math courses, I think, because of the contrasting level of difference in rigor 
              with pure math courses and also because of I was romanticized by Hardy's philosphy on pure math. Anyway, in this last semester of my undergrad, I again had to 
              give a optional backpaper in the Quantum mechanics course which I had to take if I wanted to pass with distinction. During those vacation days, when I had to just focus
              on physics, I realized how wonderfully strange quantum mechanics is and theory of Hilbert spaces and Unitary operators have some meaning in the real world too.
             I was reading it from the wonderful little book by J. Griffiths. After the exams, I was fascinated the phenomenon of spin and I went through so many books to really 
              understand it. I think Feynman's lectures (3rd vol.) give  a very good explanation for a  beginner.

      <h5> Geometry</h4>
      
      <p>Well, it's geometry!   </p>
